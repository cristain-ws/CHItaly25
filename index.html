											<h2>Overview</h2>
												<p>
													Crime, in all its forms, poses a risk to collective safety and well-being. Supporting law enforcement with advanced tools
													is essential to improve safety and the impact of criminal activities.</br>

													In the specific case of violent crime, one of the most effective investigative tools currently available is forensic
													evidence analysis, a technique that enables the examination of the morphology and distribution of physical traces at 
													the crime scene, providing valuable elements for the reconstruction of events. However, despite the existence of specific 
													guidelines, investigations are often inaccurate due to several critical issues: contamination of the crime scene, biased 
													analysis due to human error, poor communication between the actors involved, and difficulties in preserving the integrity 
													of the evidence collected.
													
													To address these issues more effectively, it is crucial to adopt <strong>innovative technological solutions</strong> that introduce more
													advanced methodologies and tools in crime scene management. These approaches allow for filling existing gaps, optimizing
													time and cost, and reducing the risk of contamination of evidence. Emerging technologies, particularly <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>,
													can make significant contributions through tools such as automated evidence collection, advanced analysis with decision support,
													and digital reconstruction of crime scenes.	More generally, it is crucial to develop innovative solutions to deal with different forms of crime, such as assault,
													gender-based violence or theft, phenomena that are unfortunately becoming increasingly common in today's society. 
													Technologies such as <strong>machine learning</strong>, <strong>computer vision</strong>, and <strong>augmented reality</strong>, including wearable devices, 
													open up new possibilities to support investigations and provide concrete assistance to victims.	These innovations can increase investigative effectiveness, 
													improve the perception of public safety, and reduce operational costs. A key element is <strong>human-computer interaction</strong>, which ensures intuitive tools
													that can be easily used by professionals in the field.
