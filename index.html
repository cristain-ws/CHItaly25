											<h2>Overview</h2>
												<p>
													Crime, in all its forms, poses a risk to collective safety and well-being. Supporting law enforcement with advanced tools
													is essential to improve safety and the impact of criminal activities.</br>

													In the specific case of violent crime, one of the most effective investigative tools currently available is forensic
													evidence analysis, a technique that enables the examination of the morphology and distribution of physical traces at 
													the crime scene, providing valuable elements for the reconstruction of events. However, despite the existence of specific 
													guidelines, investigations are often inaccurate due to several critical issues: contamination of the crime scene, biased 
													analysis due to human error, poor communication between the actors involved, and difficulties in preserving the integrity 
													of the evidence collected.</br>
													
													To address these issues more effectively, it is crucial to adopt <strong>innovative technological solutions</strong> that introduce more
													advanced methodologies and tools in crime scene management. These approaches allow for filling existing gaps, optimizing
													time and cost, and reducing the risk of contamination of evidence. Emerging technologies, particularly <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>,
													can make significant contributions through tools such as automated evidence collection, advanced analysis with decision support,
													and digital reconstruction of crime scenes.	More generally, it is crucial to develop innovative solutions to deal with different forms of crime, such as assault,
													gender-based violence or theft, phenomena that are unfortunately becoming increasingly common in today's society. 
													Technologies such as <strong>machine learning</strong>, <strong>computer vision</strong>, and <strong>augmented reality</strong>, including wearable devices, 
													open up new possibilities to support investigations and provide concrete assistance both to victims and practitioners of this area.
													These innovations can increase investigative effectiveness, improve the perception of public safety, and reduce operational costs. A key element is <strong>human-computer interaction</strong>, which ensures intuitive tools
													that can be easily used by professionals in the field. This includes building trust in automated systems, supporting human oversight and interpretability, 
													and enabling collaborative decision-making between humans and machines.

											<h2>Topics</h2>
											This workshop aims to serve as a venue to discuss ongoing research and exchange 
											ideas for researchers and practitioners who are working, or would like to start 
											working, on solutions to assist law enforcement agencies in analysing and managing 
											the investigation process through artificial intelligence, by focusing on usability, transparency, and responsiveness. 
											HCI ensures that professionals across various domains can confidently integrate AI tools into their workflows,
											 without requiring deep technical knowledge of the underlying algorithms. We aim to encourage 
											participation in order to have a stimulating discussion from different 
											perspectives. Topics may include but are not limited to:
